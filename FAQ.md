## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I sync my tablet and phone?
##### Device Name Matters
To keep your episodes in sync across all your devices (phone, tablet, etc.), make sure they all use the same AntennaPod device name. For example, if your phone's AntennaPod app is named "antennapod_sm9," choose the same name on your tablet instead of creating a new one like "antennapod_tab10."        
##### Checking Sync Status
Open the AntennaPod app on any device, Go to Settings, Select Synchronization and you'll see the latest sync status, including the date and time of the last successful sync.
##### Peek at Queue Status 
You can also check your episode queue status (played vs. unplayed) using PodFerry [web player](https://www.podferry.com/dashboard/player) and see if the episodes you want are there.

Remember: Only episodes you've actually listened to will be synchronized. Unplayed items in your inbox or queue won't be synced across devices.

### What apps and protocols are compatible with PodFerry?
PodFerry is compatible with gPodder.net protocol v2. It has been tested with AntennaPod, but compatibility with other gPodder clients or older protocol versions have not been verified. There are no plans to support other variations.
For desktop listening, complementary to AntennaPod mobile app, you may use the [web player](https://www.podferry.com/dashboard/player) that works in any browser.

### Why do my episode playback statuses differ between AntennaPod and PodFerry player?
It appears that AntennaPod only tracks playback progress for episodes that were initially started within its own app. Episodes started in PodFerry might not have their playback positions recognized or updated in AntennaPod. Conversely, episodes initiated in AntennaPod resume correctly in PodFerry. Unfortunately, there might not be a solution on the PodFerry side to address this issue.

### Why does the number of subscriptions shown in PodFerry's settings differ from the number displayed in the player?
The settings page accurately reflects the total number of subscriptions stored and accessible by your account. The subscription count in the player might be influenced by factors like free subscription tier, resource limitations aimed at optimizing service for all users or third party CORS policy limitations".

### Why hasn't my plan changed?
Typically, after a donation, the subscription status updates within minutes.
However, if a different email was used through our third-party payment provider, manual reconciliation may be needed to link the payment with the subscription.
In most cases, this issue is resolved automatically within 48 hours without any action on your part.
If you encounter any problems, please reach out via the Support [form](https://www.podferry.com/help/requestform).
