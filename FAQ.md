## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why hasn't my plan changed?
Typically, after a donation, the subscription status updates within minutes.
However, if a different email was used through our third-party payment provider, manual reconciliation may be needed to link the payment with the subscription.
In most cases, this issue is resolved automatically within 48 hours without any action on your part.
If you encounter any problems, please reach out via the Support [form](https://www.podferry.com/help/requestform).

### What apps and protocols are compatible with PodFerry?
PodFerry is compatible with gPodder.net protocol v2. It has been tested with AntennaPod, but compatibility with other gPodder clients or older protocol versions have not been verified. There are no plans to support other variations.
For desktop listening, complementary to AntennaPod mobile app, you may use the [web player](https://www.podferry.com/dashboard/player) that works in any browser.

### How can I sync my tablet and phone?
##### Device Name Matters
To keep your episodes in sync across all your devices (phone, tablet, etc.), make sure they all use the same AntennaPod device name. For example, if your phone's AntennaPod app is named "antennapod_sm9," choose the same name on your tablet instead of creating a new one like "antennapod_tab10."        
##### Checking Sync Status
Open the AntennaPod app on any device, Go to Settings, Select Synchronization and you'll see the latest sync status, including the date and time of the last successful sync.
##### Peek at Queue Status with PodFerry player: You can also check your episode queue status (played vs. unplayed) using PodFerry web player at https://www.podferry.com/dashboard/player and see if the episodes you want are there.

Remember: Only episodes you've actually listened to will be synchronized. Unplayed items in your inbox or queue won't be synced across devices.
