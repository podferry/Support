    *   **Answer:**
        1.   Device Name Matters: To keep your episodes in sync across all your devices (phone, tablet, etc.), make sure they all use the same AntennaPod device name. For example, if your phone's AntennaPod app is named "antennapod_sm9," choose the same name on your tablet instead of creating a new one like "antennapod_tab10."
        2.   Checking Sync Status: Open the AntennaPod app on any device, Go to Settings, Select Synchronization and you'll see the latest sync status, including the date and time of the last successful sync.
        3.   Peek at Queue Status with PodFerry player: You can also check your episode queue status (played vs. unplayed) using PodFerry web player at https://www.podferry.com/dashboard/player and see if the episodes you want are there.
        Remember: Only episodes you've actually listened to will be synchronized. Unplayed items in your inbox or queue won't be synced across devices.
